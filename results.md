**Project:** Distill an expensive metagradient data-quality oracle into a cheap classifier for data selection in continued pretraining (CPT). See `design_doc.md`.

**Status:** 🚧 In progress — started 2026-06-20.

## 0. Setup & environment

| Component | Choice |
|---|---|
| Metagradient engine | JAX 0.10.2 + optax (unrolled differentiable Adam, `jax.grad`, `remat`) |
| Eval / features | PyTorch 2.10 (`/root/ai-env`) |
| Model | GPT-2 small (124M) |
| Testbed | Continued pretraining (CPT) |
| Target domain `Φ` | held-out LM loss on PubMed biomedical abstracts |
| Corpus `D` | mixture: PubMed (good) / C4 web (off-domain) / token-shuffled PubMed (corrupt) |
| Hardware | 8× H100 80GB (single node) |

Method recap: metagradient `τ_i = ∂Φ/∂w_i` at `w=1` via backprop through a short Adam inner loop; goodness `s_i = −τ_i`. Distill `s` into a cheap regressor over features, score the whole corpus, keep top-`n`.

## 2. Detailed results

_(populated as experiments complete; newest first within each subsection)_

### 2.0 Sanity checks
- **GPT-2 JAX forward validated** (2026-06-20): on held-out data, val(pubmed) ppl=32.2, good(pubmed)=31.2, offdomain(c4)=37.4, corrupt(shuffled)=4137. Correct ordering → the testbed has a clean ground truth (target=pubmed ⇒ good < offdomain ≪ corrupt in loss).
- **Metagradient unit test PASS** (2026-06-20): tiny 2-layer model, T=4. `tau = ∂Φ/∂w` finite & non-zero; sign sanity holds — val-matching "good" seqs score +0.92 vs random "corrupt" −0.91 (good > corrupt). Fixes that mattered: eps *inside* Adam's `sqrt(v+eps)` (else 0·∞=NaN for zero-grad params), moderate attention mask value −1e9 (not `finfo.min`) for stable 2nd-order grad.

## 3. Notes, surprises, decisions
- 2026-06-20: Project kickoff. Metagradients in JAX (per requirement); direct unrolled Adam since `T` is small (REPLAY reserved for scaling).
- 2026-06-20: **Feasibility measured before running** (`FEASIBILITY.md`). One metagrad round (GPT-2 small, no block-remat): k=64, L_inner=128, T=16 → 52 GB peak (75 GB live under the platform allocator while streaming rounds), 3.24 s/round. Memory is dominated by the unrolled-trajectory carries (∝T), nearly flat in k; L_inner=256 and k≥96 OOM. Per-block remat fixed memory but made 2nd-order compile ~10 min → rejected; chosen lever is more (cheap) rounds at moderate k.
- 2026-06-20: Chosen knobs — M=50k, T_seq=256, L_inner=128, k=64, T=16, coverage C=4, budget n=top-10% tokens (ablate 1/5/10/25%).
- 2026-06-20: **Phase-1 labeling running** on all 8×H100 (3200 rounds total, ~22 min, wandb group `labeling-main`).
